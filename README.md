### Running

The program can be run by entering the firmware settings, turning off secure boot, and selecting the disk as the device to boot from. 


## Built in Options
### Hardware upscaling
When hardware upscaling is on, the program will use the application processors of the machine to quickly render the game buffer into the target 1024x1024 buffer. Otherwise if off, the program will simply output the 256x256 buffer to the screen. 
```
UPSCALE_MODE	DQ 00H	;0 FOR MULTI-CORE HARDWARE UPSCALED IMAGE OUTPUT, 1 FOR NO UPSCALING
